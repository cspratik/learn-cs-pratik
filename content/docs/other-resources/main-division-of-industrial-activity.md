##### Main Division of Industrial Activity Code by MCA, Main Division of Industrial Activity of Company and LLP, List of Main Division of Industrial Activity

### Background

**Ministry of Corporate Affairs** (MCA) has published a separate list of Industrial Activity codes and Business / Profession code for Company / LLP Registration. The list of industrial activity codes that MCA has published is a selected version of NIC Classification summarized by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. It is a 2 digit code representing the main divisions of NIC Classification.

Industrial Activity Code and Business / Profession code is required to be filled in the Spice+ MCA forms for Company Registration and FiLLip Forms for LLP Registration.&#x20;

In the case of the Company, the selected industrial activity code becomes part of the Corporate Identification Number (CIN).

In case of filing SPICE+ Part B for incorporation of Company and while filing FiLLiP for incorporation of LLP, this Business Code / Industrial activity code is to be filled up based on the proposed business activities of Company or LLP.
