##### Is Filing of Form ADT-1 Mandatory for First Auditor Appointment?

There has often been confusion regarding whether Form ADT-1 must be filed for the appointment of the **first auditor** under the Companies Act, 2013. Let's clarify this step by step.

### Section Governing First Auditor Appointment

The **first auditor** is appointed under **Section 139(6)** of the Companies Act, 2013:

### Provision for Filing Form ADT-1

Form ADT-1 is filed **under the fourth proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 139** as per **Rule 4(2) of the Companies (Audit & Auditors) Rules, 2014**.  

- It is primarily meant for auditor appointments under **Section 139(1)**.  
- Interestingly, Form ADT-1 also provides an option to indicate **First Auditor Appointment**.

### MCA Clarification

Previously, the **Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)** had not explicitly stated whether filing ADT-1 was mandatory for first auditor appointments.  

However, in the **FAQs issued on 7th July 2025** regarding migration from MCA V2 to V3 ([link](https://www.mca.gov.in/bin/dms/getdocument?mds=obd2Sfxdh0Lui3yMybiT7A%253D%253D&type=open)), MCA clarified:

> While filing Form ADT-1 is **not mandatory** for the first auditor appointment, it is **recommended** to do so for better transparency and record-keeping.
