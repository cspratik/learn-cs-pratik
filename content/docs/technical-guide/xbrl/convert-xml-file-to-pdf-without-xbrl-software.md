## Background

[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)](https://www.mca.gov.in/content/mca/global/en/home.html) had introduced, in a phase-wise manner, filing of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss account statements in [XBRL](/docs/technical-guide/xbrl/applicability-of-xbrl) which shall be done by [specified companies](/docs/technical-guide/xbrl/applicability-of-xbrl) from Financial Year 2011-12 onwards through filing of Form AOC-4 XBRL.

The language is XML-based and uses the XML syntax and related XML technologies. XML file is readable by Computer but it can not be read by human. When we download Annual Filing Forms from MCA's View Public Documents services for [a company to which XBRL is applicable](/docs/technical-guide/xbrl/applicability-of-xbrl), we get XML file which is created using XBRL language. In such case, it becomes necessary to convert those XBRL files to PDF format (human can read) so that one can read and analyse the same.

XBRL file can be converted to PDF without XRBL software in following easy ways.
